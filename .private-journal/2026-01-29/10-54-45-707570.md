## Project Notes

Momentum vs snapshot-mcp-server analysis complete. The snapshot server works because it's simple (~310 lines, 2 files, flat data model, no sessions, no cloud sync). Momentum has accumulated complexity (sessions, importance levels, cloud sync on every save, in-memory currentSessionId state) that makes it fragile. The Ralph Loop hook is asking the right strategic question - momentum's value proposition is shrinking as Claude Code's compaction improves, and memory-mcp with passive hooks may subsume the use case entirely. My honest recommendation is deprecation in favor of memory-mcp, but the user hasn't responded to that yet - the hook fired again which just means they're still in the session.
